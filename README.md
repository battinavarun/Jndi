Features
Lookup and bind resources using JNDI.
Handle data sources (e.g., databases) through resource references.
Integration with application servers (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss) for managing resources.
Configuration for JDBC connections via JNDI.
Example code for performing basic JNDI operations.
Technologies Used
Java EE
JNDI for directory services and resource management.
JDBC for database connectivity (optional).
Apache Tomcat (or any other Java EE compatible server).
Maven for build management.
